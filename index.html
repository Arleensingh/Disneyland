            <p>Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the 
            Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park 
            designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was 
            originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland 
            Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was the first Disney theme
            park.
            </p>
            <p>Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks 
            with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction 
            adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized 
            that the proposed site was too small. After hiring the Stanford Research Institute to perform a 
            feasability study determining an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) 
            site near Anaheim in 1953. The Park was designed by a creative team, hand-picked by Walt from 
            internal and outside talent. They founded WED Enterprises, the precursor to today's Walt Disney 
            Imagineering. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press 
            event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.</p>
